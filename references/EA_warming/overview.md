## Tan et al. (2021, International Journal of Climatology)
- ECS winter SST responds strongly to the global warming acceleration–hiatus sequence: >1.1 degC/dec (1980–1989), >0.8 degC/dec (1990–1999), then ≈ -0.5 degC/dec cooling (1998–2013).
- EAWM weakness/strength modulates latent and sensible heat loss, amplifying warming/cooling.
- Kuroshio transport intensification in the 1990s and weakening in the 2000s respectively reinforce the warm and cool phases; surface flux (Qnet) dominates in the 1980s and early 2000s, while ocean advection (including Ekman) dominates the 1990s warming.

## Tang et al. (2009, Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology)

- Winter warming (~0.24 degC basin mean) correlates with Shanghai air temperature (r ≈ 0.65), implicating weakened winter monsoon forcing, while local Changjiang runoff modulates coastal cooling.

## Tang et al. (2020, Scientific Reports)
- Finds offshore China SST reacceleration in 2011–2019 with trends ~0.45 degC/dec overall and 0.83 degC/dec in the ECS—roughly double global ocean rates.
- Attributes the warming flip mainly to the IPO ascending phase: tropical Pacific SLP anomalies induce southerly wind anomalies that push warm water northward and weaken climatological northerlies, invoking wind–evaporation–SST feedbacks that reduce heat loss.
- Reports strong co-variability with AMO (r≈0.73) and PDO (r≈0.62); negative IOD and ENSO events modulate specific years, and a westward-shifted WPSH plus low-level cyclonic anomalies over China amplify rainfall and convective responses during reacceleration.
- Notes that 1° monthly SST/reanalysis datasets (1979–2019) limit regional detail and that no mixed-layer heat-budget closure is attempted, so the proposed teleconnection-driven mechanism awaits quantitative confirmation.

- PN and 34°N sections show >2 degC winter warming of the Kuroshio core, underscoring horizontal advection as a principal contributor beyond surface flux forcing.

## Wang et al. (2019, Atmosphere)
- Daily OISST reveals extreme hot SST days (EHD) rising by +15.2 days/dec and extreme cold days (ECD) falling by -10.5 days/dec since 1982.
- Mean SST correlates strongly with extremes (EHD r = 0.80; ECD r = -0.92), indicating baseline warming drives shifts in both tails.
- Weakened winter monsoon winds promote northward Kuroshio and shelf currents, fostering EHD increases along the western ECS coast.

## Wang et al. (2020, Journal of Tropical Meteorology)
- Daily OISST analysis (1982–2013) separates warming acceleration (1982–1997) and hiatus (1998–2013) to track percentile-based SST extremes across the China Seas.
- During the hiatus, cold percentiles (10th/1st/0.1st) cool sharply (-0.40/-0.56/-0.58 degC/dec) while hot percentiles (90th/99th/99.9th) decline only slightly or insignificantly.
- Despite hiatus cooling, all hot and cold extremes remain warmer than during 1982–1997 due to a ~0.3 degC shift in the mean distribution, signaling persistent propensity for marine heat extremes.

## Wang et al. (2023, Nature Reviews Earth & Environment)
- Review across multi-source datasets finds SST in seas around China warming 0.10–0.14 degC/dec (1950–2021) and 0.14–0.16 degC/dec (1982–2021), exceeding global means.
- Decadal shifts: +0.31 degC/dec (1979–1998), -0.27 degC/dec (1998–2011), +0.45 degC/dec (2011–2019) align with PDO, EAWM, and Kuroshio variability.
- Marine heatwaves intensify (duration +5–9 days/dec, frequency +1–2 events/dec, intensity +0.1–0.3 degC/dec, annual days +20–30 days/dec), highlighting compound warming risks.

## Wen et al. (2014, Geophysical Research Letters)
- Comparison of real-time PDO indices shows largest discrepancies before the 1950s and after the late 1990s due to methodological choices across centers.
- Changing the climatology period mainly adds seasonal offsets, whereas using different leading EOF patterns (shifting toward NPGO-like structure after 1980) introduces seasonal-to-decadal uncertainty.
- ERSSTv3b versus HadISST data choice yields systematic PDO differences (HadISST–ERSST divergence grows after ~1999), tied to central and northeastern Pacific SST biases.

## Yeh and Kim (2010, Continental Shelf Research)
- Winter Yellow and East China Seas (YES) warmed significantly during 1950–2008, with trends up to ~0.04 degC/yr along the continental slope.
- An NPO-like sea-level pressure anomaly induces weaker northwesterlies/stronger southerlies, reducing turbulent heat loss and warming SST.
- Nine-year running means of the SST and pressure indices correlate at r ≈ 0.79, underscoring atmospheric forcing dominance.

## Zhang et al. (2012, International Journal of Climatology)
- PN-line hydrographic data (1956–2003) estimate peak Kuroshio heat transport at ~1.69 x 10^15 W, with substantial interannual-to-decadal variability.
- Meridional wind anomalies modulate Kuroshio heat transport: southerlies enhance, northerlies reduce, identifying wind forcing as a key driver of transport changes impacting ECS SST.

## Summary Themes
- Sustained regional warming features strong decadal modulation, often governed by EAWM variability, Kuroshio dynamics, and Pacific climate modes (PDO/NPGO).
- Hiatus periods mask subsurface heat gain and altered heat transport rather than reversing long-term warming.
- Marine heatwaves and extreme heat events intensify despite episodic surface cooling, underscoring the need to consider both atmospheric forcing and oceanic advection when diagnosing East Asian SST variability.
