Less rainfall
than usual, as represented by the negative anomaly of precipitation
Embedded on a large-scale positive anomaly of the 500hPa geopotential
The key structure of
the vertical motion
is
captured in the Q-vector convergence
ïƒ 
large-scale vertical forcing
associated with the anticyclone is responsible for
reduced convective activity
and
enhanced SW radiation
