No spatial coherence in warming/hiatus period with advection
Integrating

for
one year
could lead to the increase of 50m-depth mixed layer by
1.5 °C.
integrating from
1982 to 1998
could increase temperature
20°C
, which
should be compensated by the oceanic component.
The cumulation of error inherent to the reanalysis data makes the close of budget more difficult.

oceanic circulation increases ocean temperature, which should be released to the atmosphere through upward heat flux.
