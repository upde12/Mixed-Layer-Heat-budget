The figure shows the
time
variation of SST and heat flux anomaly
The  positive SST anomaly that persisted throughout the ELT Year
(click)
was initiated by the downward heat flux anomaly from the previous winter, when El Ni√±o is in mature phase.
after slight decrease, the SST anomaly increased again in the ELT year summer, when La Nina is in developing phase.
At this time, the sign of the heat flux was upward

The opposite direction of the heat flux for these two period suggests that they are driven by different process depending on the phase of the ENSO.
Now, I will evaluate the the lower atmosphere and upper ocean during both periods.
