They exhibit distinct characteristics.
For
ELT years
, heatwave occurred throughout the year.

whereas, during
NT years
, only in the summer.
Their spatial distributions are also different.
For the
ELT year
, heatwave occurred primarily over the Western north Pacific Ocean.
whereas, for the
NT year
, over the WNP, East China Sea and East Sea.
So, which phenomena drive this distinct
distribution?
To get some insight about the mechanism, I evaluated the direction of the surface heat flux for both cases
I would like to start with ELT Year.
