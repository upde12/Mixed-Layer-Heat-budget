I would like to introduce in more detail the basin-wide mode of Lee et al. (2020), which motivated my research,
and want to suggest several scientific questions arising from it.
This figure shows the distribution of SST before large-scale warming is occurred in the summer.

The basin-wide warm anomaly in East Asia already existed from the previous winter, and its intensity slightly increased in the summer.

The equatorial Pacific was transitioning from warm SST anomaly in winter to cold SST in summer.

My first question is to answer how is the ENSO transition related to the large-scale MHWs in the western north pacific ocean and east
asian
marginal seas.
, which is not handled in this paper.
