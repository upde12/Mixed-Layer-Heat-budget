The hint can be found in the upper-level atmospheric pattern
It is highly correlated with the Circum-Global Teleconnection (CGT) pattern presented by Ding and Wang (2005)
During June of NT years, East Asia is under the influence of an anticyclone that extends from Siberia to East Asia.
in July, influenced by an anticyclone with its core located over the Korean Peninsula.
The comparison with 500hPa geopotential anomaly indicates the barotropic vertical structure.

Son et al. (2021) demonstrated that convective activities from
north-eastern
Africa to the southeastern China can force the upper-level variability in mid-latitudes.
To verify whether there were significant convective activities in these regions during NT Year, precipitation data was also plotted.
A significant positive precipitation anomaly is located on the northern Indian Peninsula in June and in Southeastern China in July.
Therefore, the enhanced convective activity in these areas is suggested as the cause of the NT Year summer MHWs.
