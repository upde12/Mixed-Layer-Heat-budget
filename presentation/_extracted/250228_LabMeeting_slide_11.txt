Q1.
Physical mechanism responsible for the surface ocean warming during the
reacceleration period
?
Prominent SST increase in the coastal region of China coincided with the downward net heat flux anomaly, with a correlation coefficient of 0.63
SST warming during the reacceleration period despite of the anomalous heat loss to the atmosphere
