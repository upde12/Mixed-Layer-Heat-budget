I want to conclude my research by answering the questions.
My first question was revealing

How the ENSO transitions are related to the peaks of the interannual component
(click)
The answer is
The ENSO teleconnections are distinct depending on the phase.
In El Niño mature phase, the MHW is related to the supplement of the warm and moist air by the Kuroshio Anticyclone
Whereas, during La-Niña developing state, it is related to the pos
it

SSHa
and enhanced Kuroshio Current

My second research question was identifying the other climate drivers for the peak years
that
do not coincide with
the
ENSO transition.

The answer is..
The upper-level anticyclonic circulation embedded in CGT-like pattern drives MHW through the enhanced downward SW radiation.
