I started with the spatial distribution of annual marine heatwave days
I want to introduce my target area first, as shown in the figure a, which include Yellow, East China Sea, South China Sea, East Sea, and western north pacific ocean.
the right figure shows the area averaged annual MHW days timeseries.
It showed two notable feature,
the first point is the long-term increasing trend along with decadal scale fluctuation
the annual MHW days was less than 10 days in 1980s, but it increased several times in recent decade.
and the other point is the large year-to-year variation.
the MHW days in 1998 is comparable with recent extreme events.
The figure b shows the regressed MHW days and percent variance
of
detrended timeseries.
the percent variance is higher than 50 percent in the WNP Ocean, SCS,  and offshore region of ECS.
and more than 30 percent over the east coast of Korean peninsula.
to separate these features, I conducted spectral analysis
