# Presentation Summary

## Decadal-Focused Update (KESS Talk Plan)
- Focus: Decadal SST variability in East Asian marginal seas (1982–2022) based on abstract; exclude MHW background/cases and interannual (ELT) sections.
- Core storyline: warming–hiatus–reacceleration, spatial patterns, spectral/indices linkage (PDO), heat-budget decomposition (Advection, Vertical Diffusion, Surface Heat Flux), large-scale drivers.
- Slide selection (from `presentation/250926_박형주_한국지구과학회.pptx`): keep 20–27, 30–33, 35–37; review/replace placeholders 28, 29, 34.
- Deliverables: 15–20 slides after pruning; unify labels/units; standardize legends.
- Next actions: (1) prune slides per selection, (2) tighten titles to claim-style statements, (3) add key numbers to speaker notes, (4) ensure terms match abstract.
