Then, how can we understand the temperature anomaly in the thermocline?
If baroclinic instability is the cause, it would appear along the strong vertical shear.
To confirm this, the vertical gradient of the zonal current is plotted.
It is evident that areas with strong vertical shear align with the temperature anomalies indicating role of the baroclinic instability
However, Ekman downwelling associated with negative wind stress curl anomalies can also generate positive temperature anomalies within the thermocline.
