Conclusion
Q1.
Physical mechanism responsible for the surface ocean warming during the
reacceleration period
?
Rapid warming of the East Asian seas was primarily coincided with
warm oceanic advection
associated with a northward current anomaly differing from the previous warming period (1982–1998) when downward heat flux anomalies dominated
Previous studies suggest that anomalies in
wind stress and WSC
may explain this northward current anomaly
Q2.
“Nonstationary”
statistical relationship with decadal-scale climate variabilities?
Correlations between SST in the East Asian marginal seas (EAMS) and Pacific decadal modes (
PDO and NPGO
) have reversed compared to earlier periods
Previously negative correlations with PDO (and positive with NPGO) shifted to positive correlations with PDO (and negative with NPGO),
limiting predictability based on historical patterns
Limitations
On decadal timescales, residuals and accumulated
errors
in ocean reanalysis data prevent
closure
of the heat budget
Determining
why patterns of Pacific decadal variability have changed from the past
, and separating these changes from anthropogenic warming effects, is beyond the scope of this research and remains an ongoing challenge
