I will briefly introduce the data and methods
I used OISSTv2 for the SST,
ERA5 for the atmospheric field
For GPCP for the precipitation,
and SODA for the oceanic field
The research period is from 1982 to 2022.
To defined as MHWs,
the SST must be higher than the 90 percentile for each calendar day.
it should last at least five days
and if the gaps between those events are two days or less, considered as a continuous event
