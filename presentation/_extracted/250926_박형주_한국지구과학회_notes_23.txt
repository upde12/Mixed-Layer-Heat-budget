My second question is related to the upper atmosphere.
They also showed that when the basin-wide MHW occurred in summer,
there was wavenumber-5 pattern encircling the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere
,

which is known as
the
Circumglobal
Teleconnection (CGT) pattern by Ding and Wang 2005.
over East Asia, there was an Anticyclonic circulation.
This anticyclonic circulation may be related with the occurrence of the MHWs
(Click)
However, they showed that the direction of the surface heat flux is upward.
therefore, the role of CGT pattern still remains unclear
here comes my second question, :
what is the role of the CGT pattern for the large-scale MHWs?
And I will also suggest the potential source region for the wave pattern.
