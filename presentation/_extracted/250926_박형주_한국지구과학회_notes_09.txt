So, I manually counted the years
when
El Ni単o to La Ni単a transitions have actually occurred.

Over the past 41 years, there were nine El Ni単o to La Ni単a transitions, which are shown by the vertical gray shading.

And six of those years coincided with the interannual component.
I will refer to them as
ELT years
.
However, there are still many peaks irrelevant to such transitions.
I will refer to them as NT years, which means non-Transition.

My another objective is identifying the other climate drivers for the peak years
that
do not coincide with
the
ENSO transition.
I conducted a composite analysis for both ELT and NT years.
