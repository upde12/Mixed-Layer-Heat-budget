Physical mechanism:
The anomalous downward (upward)
surface heat flux
accompanied by the negative (positive) winter wind speed anomaly are related to the warming (hiatus) period
Significant correlation with
EAWM
during hiatus period
From previous studies (warming â€“ hiatus period)
4.1. Atmospheric components: wind and heat
