The figure shows the map of SST anomalies during the El Niño mature phase.
You can see that positive SST anomalies are present over a wide area, including the target domain.

These positive SST anomalies coincide with regions of downward sensible and latent heat flux anomalies, caused by the warm and moist air masses.
This suggests that the marine heatwaves are driven by heat flux from the atmosphere to the ocean.

Examining the lower atmospheric circulation, we find that southerly winds are transporting warm, moist air from low latitudes to East Asia.
These southerly winds are associated with two distinct anticyclones: one located over the Kuroshio Extension and the other over the Philippine Sea.
Therefore, we can conclude that these two anticyclones played a key role for the large-scale MHWs.
In fact, the relationship between these two anticyclones and El Niño is well-documented.
