Now
i
will introduce the data and methods used in this study.
For sea surface temperature data, Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) version 2 is used
The atmospheric field is based on the ERA5
For precipitation data, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is used
and the ocean data is based on Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) 3.4.2
The research period was set from 1982, when OISST data became available, to 2022.
The MHW events were defined by applying the method of Hobday et al. (2016) to the OISST data.
For an event to be defined as an MHW,
the temperature must be higher than the 90 percentile for each calendar day.
it should last at least five days
and if the gaps between those events are less than two days , it will be considered as the same event
The baseline period for calculating the anomaly and threshold was set to the entire period, data is available.
