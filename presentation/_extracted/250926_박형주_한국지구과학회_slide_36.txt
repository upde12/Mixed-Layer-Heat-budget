Summary
During the
reacceleration period
(2011–2022), the area-averaged
SST
in the EAMS
increased at 0.83 °C per decade
, about three times the rate over 1982–2022.
The
warming
was particularly
pronounced in the ECS
, the
northwestern EJS
, and
south of Japan
.
Mixed layer heat budget analysis
Common:
Horizontal
warm advection
supported the SST-warming pattern
across the three regions.
ECS:
Kuroshio intrusion
and a
northward current anomaly
along the Chinese coast → warm advection; vertical-diffusion anomalies also supported warming with magnitudes comparable to advection.
EJS:
A
northward alongshore current anomaly
east of the Korean Peninsula → warm advection; the vertical-diffusion term appeared larger than advection but is interpreted cautiously due to strong budget uncertainty.
ECS & EJS:
WSC-forced
changes in
geostrophic currents
contributed to the warm advection.
South of Japan:
A
Kuroshio path
shift from
NLM (2012–2016)
to
LM (2018–2022)
explains the reacceleration-period SST trend via associated temperature advection.
Unlike earlier
warming and hiatus periods
that were often
explained by heat input from the atmosphere
, during
reacceleration
the
ocean variability drove the SST warming
, while the excess heat was
released
to the atmosphere.
