Before we discuss the reversibility of the MHW, we need to know how they changed on the warming climate!
The figure shows how MHW intensity and days are changed under CMIP5 RCP 8.5 scenario compared to
the
historical period
,
which means that they used a stationary threshold
.
We can find that the MHW tends to be more intensified and more long-lasting.
The intensity under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios
exceed
the natural variability near 2030.
The duration exceeds the natural variability earlier.
Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, a full-year MHW occurred in the late 21st century.
