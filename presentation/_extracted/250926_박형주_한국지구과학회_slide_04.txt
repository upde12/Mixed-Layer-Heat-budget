Introduction

90% of excess energy
due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been
taken by the ocean
, leading to sea-level rise or
extreme temperature
rise events (Zanna et al., 2019;
PNAS
).
Anomalously
warm seawater events
have occurred with
increasing frequency and duration
over the past century (Oliver et al., 2018;
Nature communication
)
The ecological impact depends on the characteristics of the warm seawater event, including its duration and intensity
