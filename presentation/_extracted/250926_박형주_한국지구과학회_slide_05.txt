90% of excess energy
due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been
taken by the ocean
, leading to sea-level rise or
extreme temperature
rise events (Zanna et al., 2019;
PNAS
).
Anomalously
warm seawater events
have occurred with
increasing frequency and duration
over the past century (Oliver et al., 2018;
Nature communication
)
The ecological impact depends on the characteristics of the warm seawater event, including its duration and intensity
The Hobday et al. (2016) provides the
hierarchical approach
to describe Marine Heat Wave (
MHW
) characteristics:
Discrete
prolonged
anomalously
warm water event in a particular
location
Introduction

Flexible definition
The definition does not assume any particular heat wave driver
MHW can be caused by a combination of atmospheric forcing and oceanic conditions
