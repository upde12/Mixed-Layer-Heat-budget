Interannual component: ELT Year – Ocean Driven
Enhance trade wind ->Evaporation ->cold SST ->
depress convection->high pressure anomaly->wave propagation
Warm IO -> activate Kelvin wave ->
Ekman divergence

Westward extension of the WNPSH in ELT Year!
The
WNPSH
is
stronger, more prolonged, and extends further west
in the ELT year than in a normal year.
The
WNPSH
is maintained by the combined effect of
Indian Ocean warming
and
Eastern Pacific cooling
via Kelvin and Rossby wave responses (Chen et al., 2016).
The relationship between ENSO transition and oceanic Rossby wave propagation needs to be further studied.
