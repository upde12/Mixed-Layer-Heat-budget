Interannual component: ELT Year
Mature Phase of El Niño (ONDJ)
Kuroshio Anticyclone
(Son et al., 2014)
The
WNPSH
is
stronger, more prolonged, and extends further west
in the ELT year than in a normal year.

The
WNPSH
is maintained by the combined effect of
Indian Ocean warming
and
Eastern Pacific cooling
via Kelvin and Rossby wave responses (Chen et al., 2016).
